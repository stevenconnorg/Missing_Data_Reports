# Please find enclosed in this folder two directories 'CIP' and 'Full.' 
# Each folder contains a Missing/Indeterminant Data Report (.pdf) and 
# an Indeterminant Data spreadsheet (.xlsx) for each AF installation
# examined. Each AF installation's geodatabase was examined for data
# integrity and compliance to the 'CIP' and 'Full' (GeoBase 3.101) 
# geodatabase schema standards.

# Begin by examining each of the missing data reports for each AF
# installation. Throughout these reports, references to individual 
# sheets within the companion Indeterminant Data Excel Workbook may
# be found where more information may be warranted.
